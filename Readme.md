# gdal

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/gdal/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/gdal)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/georust/gdal/workflows/CI/badge.svg)]

[GDAL](http://gdal.org/) bindings for [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

So far, you can:

* open a raster dataset for reading/writing
* get size and number of bands
* get/set projection and geo-transform
* read and write raster data
* warp between datasets
* read and write vector data
* access metadata

Many raster and vector functions are not available. Patches welcome :)
